changes:
  - rscadd: New amnestics (with varying utility)! Class E and G amnestics alter memories
      instead of removing them, whereas class H and I amnestics temporarily remove
      the ability to form and remember memories respectively.
  - rscadd: Class A and B amnestics now give you a hard amount of time that they wipe,
      based on how much of it is used.
  - refactor: Class C amnestics are much stronger; they cause someone to forget the
      entire EXISTANCE of the anomalous. If you want them to forget a week or two,
      use Class B amnestics.
  - rscdel: Class D amnestics have limited utility (especially under the new system),
      so they were removed
  - balance: Due to theese changes, the amnestics available in various spots of the
      map were altered.
