changes:
  - rscadd: 049 Cell refitted (view image)
  - rscadd: HCZ checkpoitn made more compact but easier to control
  - rscadd: CDCZ Checkpoint can be locked so that it may be the only access further
      into CDCZ, allowing proper checkpoint rp
  - rscadd: Maintenance tunnel from Archive to HCZ has been made impassable to make
      HCZ a truly secure unit (Most SCPs are able to steamroll their way through the
      checkpoint regardless, but now during a breach, security actually has a better
      chance at containing the beasts)
