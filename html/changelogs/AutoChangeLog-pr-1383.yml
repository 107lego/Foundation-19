  - rscadd: Examining most runes as a cult member will now show hints how to utilize
      them/how they work/what they do.

      with weak shackles.

      a short while.
  - imageadd: The cult wall now has a better sprite to indicate that it is a barrier.
  - bugfix: Examining a talisman now actually shows talisman fluff.
  - soundadd: Added new sounds for the Scarlet King (nar'sie) rising. If some admin
      tomfoolery happens (caused by me) it will play fun sounds.
