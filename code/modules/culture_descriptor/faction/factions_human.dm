	description = "The SCP Foundation, or commonly referred to as the Foundation or SCPF,\
	is a highly secretive organization that seeks to contain and keep anomalous objects, locations, and phenomena secret to the public. They designate anomalies as SCP Objects, or just SCPs.\
	The organization frequently utilizes government funding and high-tech solutions to their problems, such as creating chemical compounds from often anomalous sources to erase memories, advanced weaponry using anomalous tech, highly complex mechanisms and constructions to contain the anomalous, and human-like AIs to help run their facilities.\
	Despite this, they are far from perfect: The SCP Foundation has frequent containment breaches and civilian amnesticizations, personnel casualty and turnover rates are relatively high, and the anomalies they contain are often frequently freed by hostile factions.\
	The Serpent's Hand (SH) are directly hostile to the SCP Foundation as their goals are directly parallel: The Foundation wants to keep the anomalous contained and secret, while the Hand wants to free the sapient, friendly and non-hostile anomalous objects and reveal the existence of anomalies.\
	The Global Occult Coalition (GOC) is neutral, bordering on hostile to the Foundation, as some of their goals are parallel: The Foundation wants to contain and keep anomalies safe but contained, while the Coalition wants to destroy anomalies.\
	The Chaos Insurgency (CI) is extremely hostile to the Foundation, as the Insurgency actively weaponizes SCPs to aid in their goal of destroying the SCP Foundation.\
