	description = "Earth is the only planet in the Solar System that humans have fully colonized, with a very small number of secretive facilities run on it's moon by the SCP Foundation. It's atmosphere is somewhat polluted, it's governments are far from united and peaceful with each other, and war is a common occurrence. Despite this, it holds billions of people who survive, and even thrive, on it. Lots of artificial man-made satellites launched by corporations and agencies orbit it, and it is a very technologically advanced planet."
